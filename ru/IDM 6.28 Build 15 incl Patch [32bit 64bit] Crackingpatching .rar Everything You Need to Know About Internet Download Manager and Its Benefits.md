How to use CMAA Specification 70 effectively?
 
CMAA Specification 70 is not a legal document or a code of practice. It is a voluntary guideline that provides recommendations and best practices for crane design and performance. Therefore, it is up to the crane manufacturers and users to decide how to use CMAA Specification 70 effectively in their specific situations.
 
One way to use CMAA Specification 70 effectively is to consult it during the crane selection process. By using the crane inquiry data sheet provided in the specification, the customer can communicate their needs and expectations to the crane manufacturer clearly and accurately. The crane manufacturer can then use CMAA Specification 70 as a reference to design and build a crane that meets or exceeds those needs and expectations.
 
Another way to use CMAA Specification 70 effectively is to refer to it during the crane inspection and maintenance process. By following the recommendations and guidelines in the specification, the crane user can ensure that their crane is in good working condition and complies with the relevant standards and regulations. The crane user can also identify any potential issues or defects that may affect the performance or safety of the crane and take appropriate actions to correct them.
